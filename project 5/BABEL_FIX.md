# Babel Configuration Fix

## Issue
The app was showing the following error:
```
[BABEL]: expo-router/babel is deprecated in favor of babel-preset-expo in SDK 50.
```

This error occurred because the app was using an outdated Babel plugin configuration for expo-router in SDK 50.

## Solution
We fixed this by updating the `babel.config.js` file to remove the deprecated plugin.

### Changes Made:

1. Removed the deprecated plugin from `babel.config.js`:
   ```js
   // Before
   module.exports = function(api) {
     api.cache(true);
     return {
       presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
       plugins: [
         // Required for expo-router
         'expo-router/babel',
         // Reanimated plugin (needs to be listed last)
         'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
       ],
     };
   };
   
   // After
   module.exports = function(api) {
     api.cache(true);
     return {
       presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
       plugins: [
         // Reanimated plugin (needs to be listed last)
         'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
       ],
     };
   };
   ```

## Why This Works
In Expo SDK 50, the functionality previously provided by the `expo-router/babel` plugin has been integrated into the `babel-preset-expo` preset. This means we no longer need to include the `expo-router/babel` plugin separately.

By removing the deprecated plugin, we avoid the error and allow the app to use the integrated functionality from the preset.

## Additional Notes
- This change is specific to Expo SDK 50 and later versions.
- The `babel-preset-expo` preset now includes all the necessary configurations for expo-router.
- Always keep your babel configuration up to date with the Expo SDK version you're using.
